"""
a form is a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> that allow a visitor to do things like enter text, 
select options, manipulate objects or controls, and so on, and then send that information back to the server.
As well as its <input> elements, a form must specify two things:

where: the URL to which the data corresponding to the userâ€™s input should be returned
how: the HTTP method the data should be returned by
